# SETimes.SR.doc: South-East European Times corpus in Serbian, divided into documents
This repository contains a variant of the SETimes.SR corpus from the [Regional Linguistic Data Initiative repo](https://github.com/uzh/reldi/tree/master/corpora) which has been annotated with document boundaries.
The starting corpus already contained morphosyntactic (MSD) tags and lemmas and was structured according to the CoNLL file format.
The document boundaries and ID numbers were created in accordance with the existing division of the [SETimes.HR corpus](https://github.com/nljubesi/hr500k/) into documents.

SETimes.SR.doc can be downloaded as:
* A [single CoNLL-formatted file](https://github.com/vukbatanovic/SETimes.SR.doc/releases/download/v1.0.0/set.sr.doc.conll) which contains the document start/end tags.
* A [collection of CoNLL-formatted documents](https://github.com/vukbatanovic/SETimes.SR.doc/releases/download/v1.0.0/set.sr.docs.zip) in which the text of each document is placed in a separate file. The file names correspond to document ID numbers.
